 # Go Fully Manual

You're not supposed to every really turn off the garbage collector in Go, except for debugging and profiling. But Go still gives us the power to turn it off and manage memory manually. It's still not a good idea, but this is a crude attempt at making it work. `alloc` exposes `Allocate`, `Free` and `Sizeof`, Go versions of the famous functions you know and love from C. `alloc` uses `mmap` and `munmap` to request memory from the OS and free it when you're done. It maintains an explicit free list to track allocations and free blocks. It attempts to be efficient with allocations, reusing freed blocks and coalescing to reduce fragmentation. It's faster than the regular allocator when doing lots and lots of allocations. But it is built entirely on unsafe and volatile constructs. Use at your own risk.
